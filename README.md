# alab-unity-game

Alab is an e-learning tool created to supplement learning in the course General Elective - Readings in Philippine History. Users are tested at the end of every stage using an Adaptive Questioning Algorithm whose role is to supply sets of unique questions in each run. 

The game has a total of 4 stages, each relating to a specific time in history, specifically the major events leading to the Battle of Mactan in the Pre-Colonial Era.
